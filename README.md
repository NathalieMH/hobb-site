# HoBB Site — MVP1 Skeleton

**How your parents will edit:**
- Add an apartment: create a new file in `src/content/apartments/` using `TEMPLATE.md`.
- Add a room: create a new file in `src/content/rooms/` using `TEMPLATE.md`.
- Upload photos: drag images into `public/rooms/` and reference them in the room's `images` list.

**Deployment (GitHub only):**
- Commit to `main`. GitHub Actions builds the site and GitHub Pages hosts it.
- Set Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions. Add a custom domain later if needed.

**Local dev (optional):**
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
